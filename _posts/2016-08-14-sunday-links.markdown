1. Nice collection of posts on [using python for Andrew Ng's machine learning course](http://www.johnwittenauer.net/machine-learning-exercises-in-python-part-1/){:target="_blank"}.  
<small>_key_awaytaking_: never stop learning about how to learn machine learning</small>

2. What is life like [as an engineer](https://twitter.com/MIT_CSAIL/status/762325954135887872){:target="_blank"}?

<small>_key_doctorphil-ism_: if you're good with failing, you're failing to be good</small>

5. Maybe [random forests are good enough for most machine learning problems](https://twitter.com/randal_olson/status/762665960625082368){:target="_blank"}?  
<small>_key_awaytaking_: but gradient boosted trees still probably better</small>

6. The New Economy: [the robots are coming!!!](https://twitter.com/claudiakincaid/status/761148652584919040){:target="_blank"}

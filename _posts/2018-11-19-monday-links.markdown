As the year 2018 draws to a close, I wanted to give thanks to some of the people on Twitter who enlightened and inspired me during the year. In no particular order...

- __[@jeremyphoward](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward){:target="_blank"}__ - an absolute must-follow for anyone interested in deep learning and machine learning 

- __[@UrbanFoxxxx](https://twitter.com/UrbanFoxxxx){:target="_blank"}__ - always posts the coolest photos and artwork of urban environments

- __[@rasbt](https://twitter.com/rasbt){:target="_blank"}__ - another must-follow for anyone learning machine learning

- __[@audreywatters](https://twitter.com/audreywatters){:target="_blank"}__ - a self-proclaimed "ed-tech Cassandra," she provides a needed contrarian view of tech's impact on education

- __[@benthompson](https://twitter.com/benthompson){:target="_blank"}__ - absolutely the best perspective on the business of tech

- __[@PatrickMahomes5](https://twitter.com/PatrickMahomes5){:target="_blank"}__ - a young man of 23 years who gives hope to this life-long kansas city chiefs fan (yes, i'm a big huge kc fan! 😎)

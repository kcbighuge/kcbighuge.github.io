I am finally with website, and I hope to give good website to you all.

Big shout out to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} for making it all possible.

You can look for me on [github](https://github.com/kcbighuge){:target="_blank"}, where you'll find memorable code snippets such as:

{% highlight python %}
from sklearn import svm
clf = svm.SVC(random_state=0)
clf.fit(X_train,y_train)
print clf.score(X_test, y_test)
{% endhighlight %}

and the unforgettable...

{% highlight matlab %}
J = nnCostFunction(nn_params, input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size, ...
                   num_labels, X, y, lambda);
{% endhighlight %}

Feel free to reach out and say hello. My (limited) powers are [at your command](http://pbfcomics.com/commisioned/Herald_of_Galactus/){:target="_blank"}.

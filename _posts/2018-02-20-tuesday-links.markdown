As a rabid consumer of all things [AI/ML/Deep Learning](https://www.scaler.com/topics/what-is-deep-learning/), I completely agree with the below tweet regarding all the AI email newsletters that are out there. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone needs to put all the AI newsletters onto a blockchain.</p>&mdash; Benedict Evans (@BenedictEvans) <a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/963134473167560704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2018</a></blockquote>

I'm not a blockchain expert by any means, so assuming that this tweet is merely suggesting that there's too much overlap in the content of these newsletters, we could concoct a remedy by [getting a list of unique](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-get-unique-values-list/){:target="_blank"} content links with something like: 

```
import numpy as np  
unique_ai_links = np.unique(all_ai_links)  
```
<small>(impressive coding skills, I know)</small>

Although this could be a fun project to implement one day, for now I just put together the below list of newsletters that would be nice to include. It falls woefully short in covering everything that you could subscribe to, but that's why this post is titled "A to I" instead of "A to Z".  <small>(cue applause)</small>

7. And while it's not technically a newsletter, if you want a true firehose of AI/ML content, you can always check out my ["data" list on twitter](https://twitter.com/kcbighuge/lists/data){:target="_blank"}.

And in closing, no post of links would be complete without something interesting from [Colossal](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/){:target="_blank"}, like these [photos of street puddles](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2018/01/local-preacher-neon-puddles/){:target="_blank"} by [Slava Semeniuta](https://www.behance.net/thisset){:target="_blank"}.
